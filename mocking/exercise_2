Exercise 2
The following code snippet is given:



import random
from unittest.mock import Mock
 
 
techs = ['python', 'sql', 'java', 'aws', 'c++']


The random.choice() method selects a random element from the iterable object.

Mock the random.choice() method from the random built-in module so that when this method is called, it returns 'aws' each time. Use the return_value argument of the Mock class for this purpose. Then call the random.choice() method and print the result to the console.



Expected result:



aws
