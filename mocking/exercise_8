Exercise 8
The implementation of the get_message() function is given in message_generator.py file. Implement a class named TestGetMessage that inherits from unittest.TestCase and in this class implement a test method named test_get_message_with_friday(). The method is designed to test the get_message() function. This function uses the message_generator.get_today_name() function and works depending on when it is called.



Using the @patch() decorator mock the message_generator.get_today_name function within test_get_message_with_friday(), so that the function call returns 'Friday' in the test method. Then, assert the result of calling get_message() with the expected result 'Hello Friday!'.



You only need to define the class and the appropriate tests. During the solution verification, the tests are run and in case of any errors, the test report will be printed to the console.
