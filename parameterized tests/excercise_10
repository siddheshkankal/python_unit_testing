Exercise 10
Suppose you have the function that calculates the lengths of the strings in a list:



def string_lengths(strings):
    return list(map(len, strings))


This function takes a list of strings as input, uses a map() function to calculate the length of each string, and returns a list of the resulting lengths.



Write the parameterized test using the unittest framework. Define a class called TestStringLengths that inherits from unittest.TestCase. Then define four test cases:

['hello', 'world'] -> [5, 5]

['python', 'is', 'awesome'] -> [6, 2, 7]

[] -> []

['1', '22', '333', '4444'] -> [1, 2, 3, 4]
