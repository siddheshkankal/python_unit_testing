Exercise 11
Suppose you have the function that calculates the quotient of the first number divided by the second number:



def quotient(numbers):
    if numbers[1] == 0:
        raise ValueError('Division by zero')
    return numbers[0] / numbers[1]


This function takes a list of two integers as input, checks if the second integer is zero, and raises a ValueError if it is. Otherwise, it returns the quotient of the first integer divided by the second integer.



Write the parameterized test using the unittest framework. Define a class called TestQuotient that inherits from unittest.TestCase. Then define six test cases:

[1, 2] -> 0.5

[10, 5] -> 2

[2, 0] -> None

[-10, 5] -> -2

[0, 1] -> 0

[0, 0] -> None
