Exercise 9
Suppose you have the function that calculates the sum of the odd numbers in a list:



def sum_odd_numbers(numbers):
    return sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 1)


This function takes a list of integers as input, filters out the odd numbers, and returns the sum of the remaining numbers.



Write the parameterized test using the unittest framework. Define a class called TestSumOddNumbers that inherits from unittest.TestCase. Then define five test cases:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> 9

[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] -> 39

[2, 4, 6] -> 0

[] -> 0

[1, 3, 5, 7] -> 16
