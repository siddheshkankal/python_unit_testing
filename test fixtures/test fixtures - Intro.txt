Test fixtures - Intro
In the unittest framework in Python, test fixtures are a way to set up and tear down the environment or conditions necessary for your test cases to run consistently and independently. Fixtures help ensure that tests start with a known and controlled state and that resources are properly allocated and released. unittest provides several methods for defining and using test fixtures:



setUp() and tearDown() Methods: Test fixtures are typically defined using the setUp() and tearDown() methods within your test case class. The setUp() method is used to set up any necessary resources or initial conditions before each test method is executed, while the tearDown() method is used to clean up or release resources after each test method finishes.

import unittest
 
class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
 
    def setUp(self):
        # Initialize resources or conditions before each test method
        self.database = initialize_database()
 
    def tearDown(self):
        # Clean up resources or conditions after each test method
        close_database_connection(self.database)
 
    def test_example1(self):
        # Test code that uses the initialized database
        pass
 
    def test_example2(self):
        # Test code that uses the initialized database
        pass


In this example, setUp() initializes a database connection, and tearDown() closes the connection after each test method.



setUpClass() and tearDownClass() Methods: If you need to perform one-time setup and teardown operations for the entire test case class (not per individual test method), you can use the setUpClass() and tearDownClass() class methods.

import unittest
 
class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
 
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        # One-time setup for the entire test case class
        cls.server = start_test_server()
 
    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        # One-time teardown for the entire test case class
        stop_test_server(cls.server)
 
    def test_example1(self):
        # Test code that uses the test server
        pass
 
    def test_example2(self):
        # Test code that uses the test server
        pass


In this example, setUpClass() starts a test server once for all test methods in the class, and tearDownClass() stops the server after all test methods have been executed.



setUp() with Context Managers: Sometimes, you might want to use context managers to set up and tear down resources within individual test methods. You can use the with statement to ensure that resources are properly handled even if an exception occurs.

import unittest
from contextlib import contextmanager
 
@contextmanager
def temp_file():
    # Create a temporary file
    file = open("temp.txt", "w")
    yield file
    # Clean up the temporary file
    file.close()
    os.remove("temp.txt")
 
class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
 
    def test_file_creation(self):
        with temp_file() as file:
            # Test code that uses the temporary file
            file.write("Hello, World!")


In this example, the temp_file() context manager is used to create and clean up a temporary file within the test_file_creation method.

Test fixtures in unittest help ensure that your test cases are isolated from each other, repeatable, and maintainable. They provide a controlled environment for your tests, making it easier to write reliable and predictable unit tests for your Python code.
